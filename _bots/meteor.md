## Comments
To unlock the legendary botframe for Meteor, you must collect 50 Star Fragments and 10 Cosmic Cores, then turn them in to Copurrnicus (located in southwest Fall Grove - Southern Slopes near the entrance to Spore Wood). Star Fragments can be obtained in the following ways:
- Reward on Season Pass (during Season of the Stars only), Arena, and for defeating QuarterBuck
- Found as detected scrap in heroic Danger Zones or randomly in normal zones (very low drop rate)

Once 50 Star Fragments are collected, talk to Copurrnicus (optional), and they will request 10 Cosmic Cores, which are obtained from defeating any Mega bot (100% drop rate) located in Botworld.
