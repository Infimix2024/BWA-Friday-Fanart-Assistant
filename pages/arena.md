## Solo Arena

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-solo">

### System

- **Opponents:** These are player-created [Comps](</comps>), controlled by the game AI, similar to recruits or bandits.
- **Matchmaking:** You get matched against opponents at around the same rank as yours, regardless of [Botpack Level](</botpack#botpack-level>). If you've been performing better than other players at your level, you'll end up facing harder opponents!
- **Arena Level:** The level displayed in Arena isn't the actual [Botpack Level](</botpack#botpack-level>), but instead the average of the 6 bots used. This doesn't affect rank.
- **Gains/Losses:** The higher your current ranking, the less you will earn per win, and the more you will lose per loss.


| Ranking Range | 0-1k          | 1k-2k         | 2k-3k         | 3k-4k         | 4k-5k         | 5k+           |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Opponents lvl | 4-11          | 8-13          | 10-16         | 14-21         | 20-25         | 25            |
| Points\*      | \+?/-?        | \+?/-?        | \+?/-?        | \+50/-50      | \+3x/-6x      | \+10/-70      |

*Notes*<br>

\- Keep in mind you will always face outliers, simply because they've performed better or worse than others for their current level.<br>

## Squad Cup

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-squad">

### System

- **Opponents:** These are player-created [Comps](</comps>), controlled by the game AI, similar to recruits or bandits. Plus each of your recruits will face the opponent's recruits.
- **Matchmaking:** You get matched against opponents at around the same Solo League rank as yours.
- **Arena Level:** The level displayed in Arena isn't the actual [Botpack Level](</botpack#botpack-level>), but instead the average of the 6 bots used. This doesn't affect rank.
- **Wins:** You must win more rounds than your opponent (including your recruits) to win the current stage. The number of rounds is based on the total number of participants (you + your recruits). If both players win/lose and even number of rounds, your remaining bots will face off in a sudden death match as a tie-breaker.

## Brad

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-brad">

**You need to pass this trial to challenge the arena masters, *you can only use your best 2 bots.* Ready to prove you are worthy?**

![300px arenamaster brad](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster-brad.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** [Slicer](</slicer>) / [Chomp](</chomp>) // **Level 2**
- **Abilities:**[Freeze](</freeze>) / [Speed Boost](</speed-boost>) / [Missile](</missile>) / [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>)
- **Unlocks**: 2 [Booster](</botpack#boosters>) slots


### Tips

- This is a fairly easy battle, just watch out for his [Chomp](</chomp>)!


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Brad:** Hi kid, I'm Brad the Arena Manager, you here to get an autograph from one of the arena masters?<br>

    \- **Player:** Nope, I've come to take them on!<br>

    \- **Brad:** One cannot simply enter the Arena, you'll have to do a trial to earn your official botpack first. I warn you, it's tough. And I don't think you're ready...<br>

    \- **Player:** I was born ready. Who do I fight?<br>

    \- **Brad:** I can conduct a trial for you. All arena masters are different, but I prefer a simple 2v2 format, no reserves.

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Brad:** Well played kid, maybe you really could join a team and become an arena star one day.<br>

    \- **Brad:** The actual masters will be much tougher than me, but you've definitely earned your new botpack today.<br>

    \- **Brad:** It's just a white series botpack. which means it only holds two boosters. But if you defeat an arena master they will upgrade it to a green series.<br>

    \- **Player:** What are boosters?<br>

    \- **Brad:** Boosters improve different aspects of your botpack or bot team. The booster you have gives you botpack energy right at the start of the battle.

</div>


## Astrid

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-astrid">


**Astrid doesn't believe in reserves, she *fights with all 6 bots at once*. Prepare for chaos and area abilities. How will you stand up to her fleet of bots?**

![300px arenamaster astrid](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster-astrid.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** 2x [Scatter](</scatter>) / 2x [Berserker](</berserker>) / 2x [Frosty](</frosty>) // **Level 6**
- **Abilities:** [Hasty Ground](</hasty-ground>) / [Chilling Ground](</chilling-ground>) / [Charge Field](</charge-field>) / [Frost Missile](</frost-missile>)
- **Unlocks:** 3rd [Booster](</booster>) slot


### Tips

- Try to force her bots to focus on your [Tanks](</bots#tanks>)
- Use [Gust](</gust>) and similar abilities to keep her [Scatters](</scatter>) at bay.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Watch where you’re going little one, I’m gonna stomp you!

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Astrid:** Waaaaaaaaa... Hmmpf. I’ve gotta admit you can handle yourself in a chaotic fight, you deserve this upgrade to a green series botpack.

</div>

## Kelvin

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-kelvin">

**Kelvin is a cool character, he uses *frost bots and abilities.* Don't expect your bots to move freely. Is it possible to make him chill out while your bots are on thin ice?**

![300px arenamaster kelvin](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster-kelvin.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** 3x [Frosty](</frosty>) / 2x [Icicool](</icicool>) / 1x [Longshot](</longshot>) // **Level 12**
- **Abilities:** [Snowball](</snowball>) / [Chilling Ground](</chilling-ground>) / [Frost Missile](</frost-missile>) / [Freeze](</freeze>)
- **Unlocks:** 1st [Gadget](</gadget>) slot


### Tips

- [Slicer](</slicer>) / [Yanky](</yanky>) with AI skills that grant immunity to slow and immobilizing effects are strong against him.
- [Sniper Bots](</bots#snipers>) can be very effective at range.
- [Chaser Stun Resistance](</chaser-stun-resistance-special>) or rare [Stun resistance](</stun-resistance-rare>) boosters can largely negate his tactics.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *After defeat*<br>

\- **Kelvin:** Wow I got melted. I'm just going to go and chill somewhere for a while. Take your blue series botpack and leave me be.

</div>


## Reginald

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-reginald">

**Reginald is a dueling master, he will fight you *one bot at a time*. Choose your counters carefully. Are your sparring skills up to the task?**

![300px arenamaster reginald](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster_reginald.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** [Slicer](</slicer>) / [Froggy](</froggy>) / [Tether](</tether>) / [Scatter](</scatter>) / [Longshot](</longshot>) / [Brute](</brute>) // **Level 15**
- **Abilities:**[Speed Boost](</speed-boost>) / [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>) / [Snowball](</snowball>) / [Super Charge](</super-charge>)
- **Unlocks:** 2nd [Gadget](</Gadgets>) slot


### Tips

**Exploited fight**

- You can *cheese the battle* by using long-lasting abilities like [Corrode](</corrode>), [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>), [Zap Tower](</zap-tower>), etc. When one of your bots dies, the enemy bot will not move until you place your next one, but the time keeps running (albeit slowed down), meaning you'll still generate Botpack Power. [Corrode](</corrode>) will still deal damage, the Towers will keep on attacking, and abilities like [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>) will continue charging and eventually explode.

- Timing your abilities well and using them right when your bot is about to die, allows your to wait for his bots to die before placing your own.

- This is especially effective to against his best 1v1 bots, [Slicer](</slicer>) and [Froggy](</froggy>).

- Always wait until you have 10 Botpack Power before placing your next bot, as it will allow you to dodge his abilities, while saving power to use when your current bot is about to die.

- Still counter his picks, but save your strongest bots to finish the fight, since you won't be able to use this method during the end game.<br>



**Fair fight**

- If you want to fight fairly, your top priority will be to *avoid the Snowballs*. Effective strategies include: getting a lucky battlefield with obstacles and/or having teleporting abilities like [Supercharged Chaos Translocator](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) available and saving botpack power to use it in a pinch.

- [Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>) can be used instead of [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>) and work considerably better, as you can choose where to teleport your bot.

- Build your team with a heavy focus towards [Snipers](</bots#snipers>), [Splashers](</bots#splashers>), and other ranged bots so you can *fight at distance*. Some [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) may be effective, however, [Tanks](</bots#tanks>) tend to perform poorly.

- Ideal abilities include: [Supercharged Chaos Translocator](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) / [Chaos Translocator](</chaos-translocator>) / [Immobilize](</immobilize>) / [Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>).

- Other decent abilities include: [Gust](</gust>) / [Freeze](</freeze>) / [Deep Freeze](</deep-freeze>) / [Super Charge](</super-charge>).

- Optionally, boosters to help generate power, such as [Power Start](</power-start-common>) or [Power Generation](</power-generation-special>).



**Notable bot interactions**

- **[Rocketeer](</rocketeer>) AI3**: With the knockback effect, it can keep bots away virtually forever. Can easily solo [Brute](</brute>) and others.

- **[Slicer](</slicer>) AI4**: Immune to slow and freeze. Great [Frosty](</frosty>) counter.<br>

- [Any more tips we’re missing?](</contribute#tbw>)



### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Reginald:** You offend me with your lack of skill, there will be barely any honor to be gained with my victory.

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Reginald:** I’m finished, done! How can I ever show my face in this town again? Here’s your red series botpack, may you glow with its magnificence.

</div>

## Jack

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-jack">

**Jack solves everything with his fists, he *fights with 4 melee bots at a time*. Don't get too close. Do your bots pack the punch needed to defeat him?**

![300px arenamaster jack](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster-jack.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** [Beat](</beat>) / [Yanky](</yanky>) / [Chainer](</chainer>) / [Thump](</thump>) / 2x [K.O.](</ko>) // **Level 17**
- **Abilities:**[Hasty Ground](</hasty-ground>) / [Charge Field](</charge-field>) / [Immobilize Field](</immobilize-field>) / [Vortex](</vortex>)
- **Unlocks:** 4th [Booster](</booster>) slot


### Tips

- He's very weak against [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>), [Bombee](</bombee>), [Evaders](</bots#evaders>), and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>).
- [Chainer](</chainer>) combos are particularly effective.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Jack:** C'mon, let’s get into it. I’m gonna thump your bots back into scrap. Don’t even think of running away.

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Jack:** Hmmph, you were just out of my reach. Go on, grab a purple series botpack, knock yourself out!

</div>





## Nicola

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-nicola">

**Nicola *never runs out of backpack power.* Prepare for a barrage of abilities. Can you keenly direct your bots to withstand her endless current of power?**

![300px arenamaster nicola](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster-nicola.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** 2x [Pluggie](</pluggie>) / [Pupil](</pupil>) / [Bigshot](</bigshot>) / 2x [Nozzle](</nozzle>) // **Level 20**
- **Abilities:** [Zap Tower](</zap-tower>) / [Charge Bolt](</charge-bolt>) / [Firewall](</firewall>) / [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>)
- **Unlocks:** 3rd [Gadget](</gadgets>) slot


### Tips

- Using [Chainer](</chainer>), [Vortex](</vortex>), [Gravity Surge](</gravity-surge>), and/or other crowd control methods to group her damage dealers together, then using Splashers is a very effective strategy.
- Try to hack her main attackers such as [Bigshot](</bigshot>), [Pluggies](</pluggie>), and [Pupil](</pupil>).
- Her [Nozzles](</nozzle>) are a big problem, because of their high HP and tanky nature. When your bots are focusing on them, they become vulnerable to [Unstable Plasma](</unstable-plasma>) and [Firewall](</firewall>).
- If she drops 2 [Nozzles](</nozzle>) at the beginning of battle, it will be a considerably more difficult fight.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Nicola:** Chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge me up, haha. Just you wait - I'm brimming with power, or don’t wait, lets battle right now, I’m wired!

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Nicola:** I’ve never felt so flat, I’m completely drained, gonna take some time out to recharge. I guess this orange series botpack is yours.



### Trivia

- Prior to the nerf of [Zap Towers](</zap-tower>) (when the ability cost was 5P and it had a higher rate of fire), she would spam the ability making for a very unfair fight. *Good times...*

</div>


## Scales

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-scales">


**Scales always strives for balance, *pairing 2 bots at a time* to make the perfect fighting team. Are you enlightened enough to ascend to this monk's level?**

![300px arenamaster scales](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster_scales.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** [Virus](</virus>) / [Froggy](</froggy>) / [Dune Bug](</dune-bug>) / [Ram](</ram>) / [Halo](</halo>) / [Slicer](</slicer>) // **Level 23**
- **Abilities:**[Supercharged Chaos Translocator](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) / [Explosive Proximity Translocator](</explosive-proximity-translocator>) / [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>) / [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>)


### Tips

- Scales doesn't want your bots to use their ultimate. If your bots stray to far from his, he will teleport his bots to yours with an [explosive entrance](</explosive-proximity-translocator>).
- [Virus](</virus>) \+ [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>) is nearly a guaranteed win, provided he doesn't have the botpack power needed for [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>). Controlling his botpack power and timing your abilities is key. 
- Using [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) on his [Virus](</virus>) can sway the early game in your favor considerably. 
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Scales:** I look forward to our duel, I always enjoy a challenge though I am confident you won't shake me.

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Scales:** I am unsettled... perhaps a new age is dawning. You deserve this prismatic botpack, the most perfectly balanced series that exists.

</div>


## Laydee

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-laydee">

**This pop star turned talent judge waits for you to place bots before delivering her “stunning” verdict. She uses *4 bots at a time* and starts placing them *only after the player has placed their own bots* onto the battlefield. Can you upstage this diva?**

![300px arenamaster laydee](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster_laydee.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots:** 2x [Mort](</mort>) / 2x [Chainer](</chainer>) / [Beat](</beat>) / [Scatter](</scatter>) // **Level 30**
- **Abilities:** [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>) / [Icewall](</icewall>) / [Immobilize Field](</immobilize-field>) / [Immobilize](</immobilize>)


### Tips

- She is essentially Jack 2.0, using [Chainer](</chainer>) combos is ideal.
- Using 2 Epic [Stun Resistance](</stun-resistance-epic>) will make her stunning aspect effectively useless.
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Laydee:** I hope you don't have stage fright, ‘cause my bots are about to hurl some critique your way!

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Laydee:** Normally I don’t take kindly to being upstaged, but that was a 10/10 performance back there. You deserve this.

</div>

## QuarterBuck

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-quarterbuck">
**There's no botpacks in this football pro's game plan - only a headfirst charge to the goal posts. Hut! Hut! Hike! Quarterbuck forces you to battle him *without using botpack abilities or choosing your bot's positions* in a 6v6 showdown. Will you tackle this arena master's challenge?**<br>

![300px arenamaster quarterbuck](</assets/img/bosses/arenamaster_quarterbuck.png>)

### Loadout

- **Bots (in order from left to right):** [Nibbles](</nibbles>) / [Bigshot](</bigshot>) / [Bullwark](</bullwark>) / [Ram](</ram>) / [Bigshot](</bigshot>) / [Bullwark](</bullwark>) // **Level 30**<br>

- **Abilities:** None


### Tips

- Quarterbuck does not use, nor allow the player to use, any botpack [abilities](</abilities>). However, [boosters](</boosters>) are still effective and [Shuffle](</shuffle>) can still cast abilities with it's ultimate.
- This battle is a 6v6 with all bots entering the battle simultaneously. Your bots are placed in the order in which they appear in your menu.
- Prioritize bots that don't rely on botpack abilities and that are self-reliant. Watch out for Quarterbuck's [Bigshots](</bigshot>)!
- [Any more tips we're missing?](</contribute#tbw>)


### Story

- *Before battle*<br>

    \- **Quarterbuck:** Once our bots line up on each side of the field and that whistle blows, there's no way you'll survive my opening tackle!

- *After defeat*<br>

    \- **Quarterbuck:** Wow, I've not seen a creative play like that since my amateur league days at Botworld U. But game recognizes game. Take this, champ.
