# Unique Bosses

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">
They are special and challenging enemies that can be found throughout Botworld!

These Bosses are either tough [Danger Zone](</danger-zones>) gatekeepers or challenging milestones for your [Codex](</codex>)'s progression

- All of them can be damaged by [Gadgets](</gadgets>), [Recruits](</recruits>) and **neutral hazards** (such as Landmines, [Molten Rock](</danger-zones#molten-rock>)'s Fireballs/Flamethrowers and Cleanerbots)
</div>

<span id="megas"></span>

## Mega Bots

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-megas">

Giant bots that can appear as bosses on [Danger Zones](</danger-zones>) or as [Contract](</contracts>) objectives

All Mega Bots have 50% stun resistance and Hack immunity ([Hack](</hack>), [Hack Missile](</hack-missile>) and [Virus](</virus>))

### **Mega Slicer**

![300px Mega Slicer](</assets/img/bosses/mega_slicer.png>)<br>

Squishy boss with a really high melee damage output

**Tips**

You should **avoid melee combat** while facing Mega Slicer, his damage output is too high to be worth tanking

- [Evader Bots](</bots#evaders>) like [Frosty](</frosty>) and [Dune bug](</dune-bug>) can keep him occupied from a safe distance
- [Abilities](</abilities>) like [Gust](</gust>), [Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>), [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) and [Vanish](</vanish>) are useful for keeping your squishy bots safe from his leaps
- [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) will bring him down in no time while he's chasing your [Evaders](</bots#evaders>)

</div>

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-megas1">

### Mega Chainer

![300px Mega Chainer](</assets/img/bosses/mega_chainer.jpg>)<br>

 Tanky boss that deals moderate AoE melee damage

**Tips**

Even though his damage is on the lower side of Mega Bots, your squishy [Snipers\]\() and [Splashers\]\() won't be able to endure his blows, so having tools to avoid his Multi-chain or to quickly take your bots out of his attack zone is essential when facing **Mega Chainer**

- Melee attackers like [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) and [Brawlers](</bots#brawlers>) should be avoided since he'll be able to hit them along with your [Tank](</bots#tanks>) ([Bullwark](</bullwark>) is a great pick due to his Front Shield and Reflective Shield)
- [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) is the best way to keep your ranged bots safe
- Teleport [Abilities](</abilities>) like [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>), [Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>) and [Team Translocator](</team-translocator>) are great responses to his Multi-chain, but [Gust](</gust>), [Shield Field](</shield-field>) and [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) are also good picks
- A well-timed [Vanish](</vanish>) can prevent a bot from being hooked, it's especially effective if used on [Bigshot](</bigshot>)
- At AI level 5 [Bullseye](</bullseye>) can attack from behind obstacles, therefore being safe from his hooks if correctly placed


### Mega Froggy

![300px Mega Froggy](</assets/img/bosses/mega_froggy.png>)<br>

 A toxic backline wiper

**Tips**

**Mega Froggy** is an elusive and tricky to deal with bot, but he's not that intimidating once you disable his Poison Tank

- Using melee damage dealers such as [Brawlers](</bots#brawlers>) or [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) isn't advisable since he can leap away from melee units and his basic attacks apply slow
- The main threat is his Poison Tank, so having tools to avoid that such as [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) or [Team Translocator](</team-translocator>) will take down most of it's offensive power
- **Mega Froggy** is a squishy boss, so using the [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) combo will take him down quite fast
- In case you enough lack ranged firepower to bring him down fast, [Link](</link>) is a great pick in terms of [Tanks](</bots#tanks>) due to his ability to protect other bots paired with his high Energy Resistance with the right AI tree


### Mega Pluggie

![300px Mega Pluggie](</assets/img/bosses/mega_pluggie.png>)<br>

 The powerhouse of Mega Bots

**Tips**

**Mega Pluggie** is an all-rounder Mega Bot, altough his health isn't that high he has melee damage reflection with Electric Shock, energy damage resistance, CC and AoE, making him one of the toughest Mega Bots around Botworld

- Avoid letting your bots stay close to each other, otherwise Chain Lightining and Electrocute will pack a really good punch
- Using melee damage dealers like [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) and [Brawlers](</bots#brawlers>) is a double-edge sword, they'll be able to stagger **Mega Pluggie**'s attacks while they chase, but Electric Shock will take your bots down quite fast
- Since he resists energy damage, using bots that deal long range physical damage, like [Bullseye](</bullseye>) and [Longshot](</longshot>) is advised
- [Link](</link>) is a great [Tank](</bots#tank>) choice due to his high energy damage resistance, along with supportive bots such as [Halo](</halo>) or [Beat](</beat>) that would provide extra damage and survivability during the fight
- Since Mega Pluggie's attack range is quite small, using [Icicool](</icicool>)'s CC + [Rocketeer](</rocketeer>)'s knockback will let you protect your ranged bots safe, allowing you to beat it from a safe distance (Credits to Kart)


Ps. [Link](</link>) can be made immune to **Mega Pluggie**'s attacks by using 4x [Epic Energy Resistance](</energy-resistance-epic>) boosters on top of his 40% Energy Resistance AI perk.

### Mega Frosty

![300px Mega Frosty](</assets/img/bosses/mega_frosty.jpg>)<br>

 The ultimate melee counter

**Tips**

Although having low damage, **Mega Frosty** can be hard to deal with if you lack proper ranged attackers, since facing him with melee bots will be extremely difficult due to his powerfull CC abilities

- Using the same strategies listed for **Mega Pluggie** against **Mega Frosty** will do the trick, but you must be prepared to reposition your bots after he teleports, since he can still beat your [Sniper](</bots#snipers>) and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>) with ease
- His slow, stun and teleports will basically disable most melee damage dealers ([Chasers](</bots#chasers>) and [Brawlers](</bots#brawlers>)), but units with CC immunity AI perks (like [Slicer](</slicer>), for example) can still be used effectively
- Poison effects can be a great tool for piling up damage ([Hornet](</hornet>) and [Fork](</fork>) \+ [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>))
- As with **Mega Pluggie**, [Link](</link>) can also be made immune to **Mega Frosty**'s attacks with the addition of 4x [Epic Energy Resistance](</energy-resistance-epic>) boosters


### Mega Dunebug

![300px Mega Dunebug](</assets/img/bosses/mega_dunebug.png>)<br>

 The fastest and most eluvise Mega Bot

**Tips**

Although squishy, Mega Dunebug is really hard to deal with if you lack enough long range firepower since you won't be able to keep him still for long

- The best way to beat him is by using [Chainer](</chainer>) and [Vortex](</vortex>) to keep him in range long enough for your [Snipers](</bots#snipers>) to take him down
- The [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) combo can nuke him down quite easily
- If you don't have enough firepower to bring him down quickly, using [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) or [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) can save you from his death roll


Ps. It might be tricky to use [Pupil](</pupil>) against him since Mega Dunebug will constantly roll around, reseting the laser's damage progression

### Mega Icicool

![300px Mega Icicool](</assets/img/bosses/mega_icicool.jpg>)<br>

 A squishy frost turret

**Tips**

**Mega Icicool** is an evasive mega bot that has plenty of slows to abuse, which means using non-CC immune [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) and [Brawlers](</bots#brawlers>) isn't a great idea. Even though he is squishy and his damage isn't high for a mega bot, his ult can easily burst one of your melee bots if it lands right

- Bursting him quickly is advised to prevent him from ulting, so the [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) is a good call for this one
- You can use [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) to keep him from ulting
- If you lack proper long-ranged damage dealers, using poison ([Fork](</fork>), [Poison Trail](</poison-trail>)) and CC immune melee bots ([Slicer](</slicer>), [Yanky](</yanky>)) will be a good way to go
- Since he's damage is energy-based, [Link](</link>) will be your best choice as a [Tank](</bots#tanks>). He and [Frosty](</frosty>) can also be made immune to energy damage with the addition of 4x [Epic Energy Resistance](</energy-resistance-epic>) Botpack boosters


### Mega Slash

![300px Mega Slash](</assets/img/bosses/mega_slash.png>)<br>

 A melee glass cannon

**Tips**

**Mega Slash** is really weak against "Hit and Run" strategies, since he has no tools to close the gap between him and your bots. Using [Evaders](</bots#evaders>) will make facing him a walk in the park

- Using melee units aside from [Tanks](</bots#tanks>) isn't adivised, **Mega Slash** has a really high damage output along with CCs, so he'll be able to beat squishy [Chasers](</bots#chasers>) rather easily
- [Frosty](</frosty>), [Dunebug](</dune-bug>) and [Flamer](</flamer>) can beat him up while keeping a safe distance, therefore being extremly effective against him
- The [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) combo will be quite effective since **Mega Slash** has a low health pool and no energy damage resistance

</div>

<span id="roaming"></span>

## Roaming bosses

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-roaming">
Special bosses that appear roaming in specific maps, they can be either **Super Bots** or **Unique Bandits** and beating them will grant a [Codex](</codex>) achievement

Super Bots have 50% stun resistance, Hack immunity ([Hack](</hack>), [Hack Missile](</hack-missile>) and [Virus](</virus>)) and a fixed loadout

Unique Bandits have 6 bots in their loadout

### Super Flamer

**Base level:** 15

![300px Super Flamer](</assets/img/bosses/super_flamer.png>)<br>

The first Super Bot you'll face on your journey

**Roams around**: [Great Desert](</maps#great-desert>) ([Route](</codex#great-desert>))

**Bots**:1x **Mega Flamer**, 1x [Yanky](</yanky>)

**Tips**

**Super Flamer** can be hard to deal with while you're underleved, since his AoE damage will be quite punishing for weaker bots

- The best way to deal with him is by using ranged bots, since he has no resistance both energy and physical damage are effective
- [Longshot](</longshot>) is a good pick and can be obtained early through the [Arena](</arena>), [Lobbie](</lobbie>) will also prove himself useful by providing consistent damage and his Ult's CC
- As for [Tanks](</bots#tanks>), you should go with a big wall to keep him occupied as long as possible, some easy-to-get choices are [Barrie](</barrie>) and [Bullwark](</bullwark>). [Chainer](</chainer>) can be obtained through the [Arena](</arena>) and could help with positioning control during the fight
- [Tether](</tether>) is easy to get and can be a really good disabler to use against **Mega Flamer**, preventing him from moving and reaching your squishy [Snipers](</bots#snipers>) and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>)
- Random Drop bots that are also great in this fight are: [Link](</link>), [Bigshot](</bigshot>), [Pupil](</pupil>), [Halo](</halo>), [Pluggie](</pluggie>) ([Arena](</arena>)), [Beat](</beat>) ([Arena](</arena>)) and [Mort](</mort>)


### Wolf Pack Alpha

**Base level:** 20

![300px Wolf Pack Alpha](</assets/img/bosses/wolfpack_alpha.png>)<br>

**Roams around**: [Fall Grove](</maps#fall-grove>) ([Route](</codex#fall-grove>))

**Bots**: 2x [Slicer](</slicer>), 2x [Ram](</ram>), 2x [Longshot](</longshot>)

### Fork Tongue Fanatics Leader

**Base level:** 22

![300px Fork Tongue Fanatics Leader](</assets/img/bosses/forktongue_leader.png>)

**Roams around**: [Saltwater Swamp](</maps#saltwater-swamp>) ([Route](</codex#saltwater-swamp>))

**Bots**: 2x [Fork](</fork>), 2x [Thump](</thump>), 2x [Froggy](</froggy>)

**Abilities**: [Poison Trail](</poison-trail>), [Hack](</hack>), [Immobilize Field](</immobilize-field>), [Vortex](</vortex>)

**Tips**

- [to be written...](</contribute#tbw>)


### Super K.O.

**Base level:** 25

![300px Super K.O.](</assets/img/bosses/super_ko.png>)

He hits hard from the start and will snowball in power as the battle drags on

**Roams around**: [Parched Sea](</maps#parched-sea>) ([Route](</codex#parched-sea>))

**Bots**:1x **Super K.O.**, 1x [Halo](</halo>)

**Tips**

**Super K.O.** is quite bulky and hits really hard, so it's not easily tanked

- [Halo](</halo>) must be taken care of as soon as possible to prevent Super K.O. from being buffed
- “Hit and Run” is the best strategy to deal with him. [Rocketeer](</rocketeer>) and [Gust](</gust>) are great for keeping him away, while [Frosty](</Frosty>) and [Dune bug](</dune-bug>) can drag him around. [Vortex](</vortex>) and [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) can be used to stagger for time and counter his speed boost
- The [Bigshot](</bigshot>) \+ [Vanish](</vanish>) combo will work just fine in taking him down, but be aware that he can quickly reach and kill [Bigshot](</bigshot>) if you fail to react after his speed boost
- The fight can be cheesed by using 2x [Corrupted Power Generation](</corrupted-power-generation>)(or 3x [Epic Power Generation](</power-generation-epic>)) + [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) to keep him permanently locked while [Bullseye](</bullseye>) steadily drain his health


### Super Virus

**Base level:** 30

![300px Super Virus](</assets/img/bosses/super_virus.png>)

The former strongest Roaming Boss

**Roams around**: [Spore Woods](</maps#spore-woods>) ([Route](</codex#spore-woods>))

**Bots**: 1x **Super Virus**, 1x [Fork](</fork>), 1x [K.O.](</ko>)

**Tips**

**Super Virus** isn't the only threat in this fight, if you focus on him [Fork](</fork>) will wipe out your [Snipers](</bots#snipers>) and [Splashers](</bots#splashers>)

- [Hyperdrain](</hyperdrain>) is essential to keep him from hacking your frontline
- The “Hit and Run” strategy used against **Super K.O.** works well against him, but it is heavier on Botpack Power because you'll need to constantly keep his ult in check. You'll also need to save Botpack Power for an emergency [Gust](</gust>), [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>), [Proximity Translocator](</proximity-translocator>) or [Barrier-wall](</barrier-wall>) to counter his Disable skill
- As with **Super K.O.**, this fight can be cheesed by using 2x [Corrupted Power Generation](</corrupted-power-generation>) (or 3x [Epic Power Generation](</power-generation-epic>)) + [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) to keep him permanently locked while [Bullseye](</bullseye>) steadily drain his health


### Super Berserker

**Base level:** 30

![300px Super Berserker](</assets/img/bosses/super_berserker.png>)

The strongest Roaming Boss

**Roams around**: [Ashen Shore](</maps#ashen-shore>) ([Route](</codex#ashen-shore>))

**Bots**: [to be added](</contribute#tbw>)

## General Tips and Tricks

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-gadget-tips">

Higher level Bosses are though to face, but there are some tricks you can use to chip their health away before actually facing them, making the fight much easier

### Use the Environment

There are several neutral hazards spread throughout Botworld, some are easy to use, others not so much, but here are some tips on how to use them effectively against most enemies.

[Shockwave Generator](</botpack#gadgets>) is your most versatile tool<br>

Its defensive applications are obvious, pushing enemies away and staggering them for a short period, but this Gadget can also be used **offensively** by pushing enemies into Landmines and Cleanerbots, or by locking them into [Poison Clouds](</danger-zones#vivid-valley>) or in a [Flamethrower](</danger-zones#molten-rock>)'s line of fire

- *Bandit pushed into Flamethrower*


[Bandit vs Flamethrower 320p (220kb)](</assets/img/bosses/Flamethrower_low_quality.mp4>)<br>

[Bandit vs Flamethrower 640p (812kb)](</assets/img/bosses/Flamethrower_high_quality.mp4>)

- *Enemy kept into a Poison Cloud*


[to be recorded](</contribute#tbw>)

You can bait them into those environmental hazards by simply running around, but using [Shockwave Generator](</gadgets#shockwave-generator>) will allow you to efficiently get the most benefit out of them

### Know your Gadgets and Plan Ahead

[Mine](</gadgets#mine>) and [Bombardment](</gadgets#bombardment>) are powerful tools for taking down though enemies when used correctly. Understanding how to lay them efficiently and knowing how much damage they deal will allow you to plan ahead on how and when you'll use them

- Damaging Wild Bots and Regular Bandits with 3x [Mines](</gadgets#mine>) will defeat them right away (no loot gained)

    [3x Mines vs Non-Boss enemies 320p (314kb)](</assets/img/bosses/3x_Mines_vs_Bandit_and_Wild_Bot_320p.mp4>)<br>

    [3x Mines vs Non-Boss enemies 640p (1,18MB)](</assets/img/bosses/3x_Mines_vs_Bandit_and_Wild_Bot_640p.mp4>)

- Damaging Wild Bots and Regular Bandits with [Bombardment](</gadgets#bombardment>) 3 times will bring them down to around 5\~10% health

    [video 3x Bombardment on Regular Enemies (592kb)](</assets/img/bosses/3x_Bombardment_320p.mp4>)<br>

    [3x Bombardment on Non-Boss enemies 640p (2,21MB)](</assets/img/bosses/3x_Bombardment_640p.mp4>)

- Damaging a [Boss](</bosses>) unit with 5x [Mines](</gadgets#mine>) will bring it down to around 5\~10% health

    [video 5x Mines vs Mega Slicer 320p (640kb)](</assets/img/bosses/5x_Mines_vs_Mega_Slicer_320p.mp4>)<br>

    [5x Mines vs Mega Slicer 640p (2,34MB)](</assets/img/bosses/5x_Mines_vs_Mega_Slicer_640p.mp4>)

- Damaging a [Boss](</bosses>) unit with [Bombardment](</gadgets#bombardment>) 3 times will take away approximately 1/3 of its health

    [to be recorded](</contribute#tbw>)



Use this data to plan ahead and choose where and how you'll use your [Gadget](</gadgets>) to get the most out of each precious charge. For example, when inside a [Danger Zone](</danger-zone>) you'd rather use your [Mines](</gadgets#mine>) instead of your [Invisibility](</gadgets#invisibility>) to easily get past a [Boss](</boss>) that's located on a narrow pathway because you know you might need to backtrack.

*Credits to @Templar and @Noob*

### Cheesing Boss fights (Mega and Super Bots)

This strategy consists in locking the [Boss](</bosses>) into a [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>) cell and make use of [Bullseye](</bullseye>)'s Third Eye perk (AI Lv5), which allows him to hit through obstacles, to theoretically take any of them down safely<br>

[video Bullseye vs Mega Chainer 320p (907kb)](</assets/img/bosses/Bullseye_vs_Chainer_320p.mp4>)<br>

[Bullseye + Barrier Wall vs Mega Chainer 640p (3,41MB)](</assets/img/bosses/Bullseye_vs_Chainer_640p.mp4>)

- You'll either need to use 3x [Epic Power Generation](</power-generation-epic>) or 2x [Corrupted Power Generation](</power-generation-corrupted>) boosters to guarantee enough Botpack Energy to keep using [Barrier Wall](</barrier-wall>), since locking the [Boss](</bosses>) with a single one isn't that reliable
- Using a [Corrupted Sharpshooter Range](</corrupted-sharpshooter-range-epic>) would allow [Bullseye](</bullseye>) to basically reach the entire field (optional)
- Don't forget that you must quickly deal with the regular Bots that accompany the [Boss](</bosses>) to prevent them from harassing [Bullseye](</bullseye>)


P.s.: Of course, there are simpler ways of cheesing specific [Boss](</bosses>) fights, like using [Frosty](</frosty>) and [Dune bug](</dune-bug>) against melee [Bosses](</bosses>), but that alone wouldn't guarantee a win in most cases since the majority of them have tools to either disable your Bots (e.g. [Super Virus](</bosses#super-virus>)'s Immobilize and Hack effects) or to quickly close the gap (e.g. [Super K.O.](</bosses#super-ko>)'s speed boost and [Mega Chainer](</bosses#mega-chainer>)'s hooks)
