## Fusing

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-fusing">

Kindly ask your dear [Auntie](/contribute#tbw) 

- You can only fuse **3 of the exact same module**. Eg: 3 [Shields](/shield)
- Fusing will get you a module of the **same type** of the **rarity one higher**
- Fusing is **always random**

**Tip:** don't be too eager to fuse anything you might want to use later!

</div>


## Botpack Level

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-botpacklevel">

- The value you see on your botpack in the top-left corner
- Impacts your damage abilities & [mobs level scaling](/exploring#level-scaling)
- Is equal to the **average of the 6 highest level bots *you own***. Even if you're not using them. Rounded up.

</div>


## Gadgets

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-gadgets">

### Usage

- **Activation:** From your botpack (bottom right while in the wild) or at the start of a fight (**turn off autobattle**). Demo:

### Damage Amplifier

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/amplifier.png>)

- **Level 1:** \+25%, 2 uses
- **Level 2:** \+30%, 3 uses


### Botpack Overclocker

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/overclocker.png>)

- **Level 1:** \+35%, 3 uses
- **Level 2:** \+50%, 4 uses


### Bombardment

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/bombardment.png>)

Each strike deals slightly less than 1/3 of a Wild Bot/Bandit's health bar worth of damage, value that is halved against [Booses](</bosses>) ([needs confirmation](</contribute#tbw>)). Striking a regular unit 3 times will leave them with close to no health, while striking a [Boss](</bosses>) 3 times will take away around 1/3 of it's health bar.

- **Level 1:** range 10, 2 uses
- **Level 2:** range 14, 2 uses
- **Level 3:** range 14, 3 uses


### Speed Amplifier

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/speed-upg.png>)

- **Level 1:** \+30%, 3 uses
- **Level 2:** \+50%, 3 uses


### Invisibility

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/invisibility.png>)

Altough preventing enemies from detecting and following you, it won't make you intangible, meaning you can still trigger traps and that bumping into enemies would still start a fight

- **Level 1:** 5 sec duration, 1 use


### Shockwave Generator

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/shockwave.png>)

- **Level 1:** 5 uses


### Mine

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/mines.png>)

Each Mine deals around 1/5th to 1/6th of a [Boss](</bosses>)' health bar worth of damage, value that is doubled against regular Bandits and Wild bots. Mines can be stacked on top of each other in order to deal multiple simultaneous hits. Damaging regular units with 3 mines will defeat them, while damaging a [Boss](</bosses>) with 5 mines will bring it's health bar down to around 5\~10% (Credits to @Noob)

- **Level 1:** 3 uses
- **Level 2:** 5 uses


### Ability Jammer

![Image](</assets/img/gadgets/jammer.png>)

- **Level 1:** 2 uses
