## Botframes

<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-botframes">

Random drops can happen anywhere from any source (piles, chests, fights...). Higher rarity chests have better chances of dropping higher rarity botframes.
Type of Wild Bots, zone location, etc., have no impact over which botframes you're most likely to find.

Any bot you can get through a special mean (reward of any kind) is only available through that mean (at that time). 
The rest is from random drops.
