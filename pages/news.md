### Botworld Wiki Launch

We, *Beat Burger & Friends*, are most excited to present to you the brand new and shiny: **Botworld Adventure community Wiki**

It's been a project running strong for the last 10 days or so, and today we believe it is ready enough to present it to you! It is *ready*, but **far from complete**! Many (most?) of the pages are shadows of what we want them to be, created as placeholder so we can fill them up together over the weeks to come.

We have some very nice and rich ones already though!

We very much hope you like it, where it can go, and hopefully send us some stuff that you noticed is still missing and you have the info.
