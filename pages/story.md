Central fountain in Scavenger's landing. If you look around, you can see famous places like Arena, Market, Barbershop. Feel free to go there if you tired from all those fights

In center of Great Desert you can see a strange monument that soaking up sun energy. Some of local residents think its a big scratching post.

### Fall Grove

In left corner of Fall Grove there is beautiful lake, named Croaking Lake. Favourite place for Botmasters fishermans.

### Saltwater Swamp

![Saltwater Swamp abandoned laboratory](</assets/img/story/visit_ss_laboratory.jpg>)<br>

If you like risk (and [Froggies](</froggy>)), you can visit Abandoned Laboratory where Swamp Monster was created

### Parched Sea

![Parched Sea restaurant](</assets/img/story/visit_ps_restaurant.jpg>)<br>

Casa Insetto, restaurant where you can taste delicious bug soup. Dont say its disgusting if you didnt tried yet!

### Spore Wood

![Spore Wood toadstools](</assets/img/story/visit_sw_toadstools.jpg>)<br>

The capital of Spore Wood - Fungal Hills. Large toadstools grow near odd houses and if you'll try to find right path you can meet Strange Lifeform itself. Be aware of Plant Gang Members, they are something more that just communists

### Ashen Shore

In Fate's end you can see giant bones. What creature could have had such big bones? Even Coggy doesnt know.
